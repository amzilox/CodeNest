## Project Overview :

**[CodeNest](https://code-nest.netlify.app)** is a landing page designed to promote software engineering education. The site features a modern and responsive design, offering an immersive experience for prospective students.

## Key Technologies :

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTML) : The backbone of the webpage structure.
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS) : Applied with advanced techniques for styling.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) : Utilized for more efficient and organized CSS management using **the 7-1 file architecture**.

## Known Issues

<p style="font-size: 1.4rem">⚠️JavaScript Functionality :</p>

Some JavaScript features are currently not working as intended, including:

- **Navigation links:** The links in the navigation menu may not function properly.
- **Popup close functionality:** Clicking on the background to close the popup is not operational.

These issues are present because <span style= "font-weight: bold">I am focusing exclusively on perfecting the CSS and Sass aspects of this project.</span> Future updates will address these JavaScript-related concerns.
